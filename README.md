OpenGL / GLFW Bindings for Idris
================================

This project contains bindngs for the OpenGL graphics system and
the GLFW utility library.

For details on OpenGL and GLFW see www.opengl.org and www.glfw.org respectively.

As of now the bindings target OpenGL v.4.1. because that's what my macbook supports.

To run the example I needed to install glfw3 and glew via brew.
